## A New Deep Learning Classifier for Pneumonia Detection

This project is about the detection of pneumonia in Chest X-Ray (CXR) images using the concatenation of two Visual Geometry Group (VGG) architectures. These two VGG architectures extract the features and accordingly, the input CXR image are classified using Fully-Connected (FC) layers, Machine Learning (ML) classifiers, and a weighted ensemble classifier. Conclusively, a mobile phone web-delivered application of pneumonia detection has been created based on the best trained model (the weighted ensemble classifier with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR) classifiers), which can predict the class of an input CXR image with a significant accuracy (98.55%). This web application can be implemented using the following Google Collab URL: https://colab.research.google.com/github/mohammadaiai/Master-Thesis/blob/main/Web%20Application.ipynb.
