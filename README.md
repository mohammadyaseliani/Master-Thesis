# Master's Thesis
This project is about the detection of pneumonia in Chest X-Ray (CXR) images using two Visual Geometry Group (VGG) architectures. These two VGG architectures extract the features and accordingly, the input CXR images are classified using Fully-Connected (FC) layers or Machine Learning (ML) classifiers. Conclusively, a mobile phone web-delivered application of pneumonia detection has been created based on the best trained model, which can predict the class of an input CXR image with a significant accuracy. This web application can be implemented using the following Google Collab URL:https://colab.research.google.com/github/mohammadaiai/Master-Thesis/blob/main/Web%20Application.ipynb.
